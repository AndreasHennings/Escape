# Escape
 An Escape Room Game
By Sarah Brand and Andreas Hennings

## What is Escape?
Imagine you're being locked inside an apartment with a time bomb. You have 5 Minutes to find a key, open the door, and escape to safety.

There are 10 keys hidden in the apartment. Some are easy to find, some are well hidden under furniture, and the most difficult ones require some logical skills to be discovered...
Beware: Once you pick up a key, you'll only have 10 seconds to escape, so make sure your way to the door is not blocked by furniture.
